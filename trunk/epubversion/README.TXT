To install this module:

1. Upload the entire epubversion folder to the the modules folder within your 
eFiction installation.

2. Go to http://yoursite.com/admin.php?action=modules  or 
http://www.yoursite.com/modules/epubversion/install.php where 
www.yoursite.com is your eFiction site's address.

3. Goto the main default_tpls folder.  Open up viewstory.tpl and 
storyindex.tpl and add {printepub} where you want the ePub icon/options 
to appear. 

4. Do the same for any skins with their own viewstory.tpl and/or storyindex.tpl

You can define $epubicon in your skin's variables.php to override the 
default ePub icon if you so desire.

There is one language definition in the en.php file in the languages folder
that provides the alt text for the ePub icon as well as the various text bits 
for the rest of the expanded modules..

The configuration variables that used to be set at the top of epubversion.php
are now set via the modules admin options panel. You can access this by 
visiting http://yoursite.com/admin.php?action=modules&module=epubversion&admin=true
or by goting to the "Admin" page, clicking on "Modules" and then clicking on the
"Options" link next to ePubVersion.

These variables are used to configure you "Brought to you by" line on the cover 
page, and the OPF's publisher information line

This module now has the ability for Authors to turn on/off ePub editions for
each of their stories. This is done via the User/Account menu, by clicking on
 "Manage ePub Stories". By default, the ePub bit is set to "0" or "Off" for 
all authors. They must "Opt In" 

5) We have added several new tags to ePubVersion that can be added to your templates.

	{printepub} -- Displays a direct Download link for ePub version of a Story.

	{printthumb} -- Displays a thumbnail Image of the epub/Book Cover is one has been 
	set in "Manage ePub Stories". Cover image is dynamicaly resized so that max width
	or height is no larger than 100px. Original Aspect ratios are kept. 
	Requires PHP Compiled with GD, and GD compiled with PNG/JPG/GIF support.

	{cover} -- Displays an Image of the epub/Book Cover is one has been set in "Manage 
	ePub Stories". Cover image is dynamicaly resized so that max width    
        or height is no	larger than 250px. Original Aspect ratios are kept. 
        Requires PHP Compiled with GD, and GD compiled with PNG/JPG/GIF	support.

	{epubcount} -- Returns the number of times a Story has been downloaded as "epub" 
	in numerical form.

Below you will find sample usage of the new skin tags as found in my index.tpl (recentblock) 
and listings.tpl (storyblock). I have made use of CSS to make the various "boxes" size 
properly around the images.
